# Rummy App

My family loves playing rummy, and my grandfather always maintained a small notebook of all our scores across the several games that we played. Inspired by this, I wanted to build an app that simplifies the score tracking process.

## Features

- Can create/edit games
- Can create/edit rounds
- Score validation: the sum of every player's score must be zero for every round
- Persistent storage using SwiftData
